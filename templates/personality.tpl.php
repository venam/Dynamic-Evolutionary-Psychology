Personality develops itself from birth.<br/>
Around half influenced by the genetic mix of the parents and half
influenced by the social norms and environment.<br/>
<br/>

<em>Around half the variations in personality, intelligence, and behavior comes from something in the environment.
<br/>
<br/>
But whatever that something is, it cannot be shared by two children growing up in the same home with the same parents</em>

<br/>
<br/>
The big five personality traits, OCEAN are heritable at around 50%.
<ul>
<li>Openness to experience</li>
<li>Conscientiousness</li>
<li>Extraversion</li>
<li>Agreeableness</li>
<li>Neuroticism</li>
</ul>
</em>
<br/>

The older we get, the more stable the personality becomes.

<br/>
<br/>
As a snowball effect, we start with a set of big traits and express them through the choices and oportunities that open themselves in front of us during life, plus a bit of luck twist.

<br/>
<br/>
It is also shaped by the norms around us, we all want to climb the social hierarchy, whatever it currently is.
