Everything alive,<br/>
All living organisms on earth have something common: the DNA.<br/>

Life could be summed up as the replication process in which the bodies are<br/>
vehicles transporting the DNA.<br/>

The DNA has specific sequences called genes defining<br/>
the vehicle's properties.<br/>
It is then replicated from one generation to the other.<br/>

All living creatures share the same 4 components in their DNA: thymine,<br/>
adenine, cytosine, or guanine. Only the sequence changes.<br/>

			<div class="presentation_left">
Some species have sequences that resemble the sequences of other species.<br/>
Some parts of the sequences are exactly the same, at the exact same spot.<br/>
In fact because we all share the basic four components we can definitely<br/>
find species closer to one another. They have some sort of relation with<br/>
that other species because they share the same long sequences.<br/>

From those relations we can draw a tree of life.<br/>
Following this premise, we can deduce that we share a common ancestor, the<br/>
initial DNA sequence. We can trace that at some point we converged in one<br/>
single entity.

Then, where does this variety comes from?<br/>
<br/>
The replication process doesn't happen randomly.<br/>
Because some replicators are better at surviving than others, their vehicle is more<br/>
suited to their current environment.<br/>
Consequently, there's an unbalance in the ones who can transfer their genes to<br/>
the next generation.<br/>
<br/>
The longer this process goes on the more varieties start to appear.<br/>
The diaspora of genes across a population will diverge.<br/>
<br/>
Slight changes will grow into totally different features.<br/>
<br/>
The abilities that are making one replicator survive and reproduce, giving<br/>
offspring that will also reproduce taking in consideration the current<br/>
environment, will be favored and the opposing qualities might not.<br/>

This has been going on for 4.6 Billion years on planet earth, an immense<br/>
amount of time.<br/>
The code in the genes is a blueprint of the baggages and history the species<br/>
have passed through to be able to cope with the world it's living in.<br/>
Blueprints are chosen through iterations of natural selection.<br/>
They are there because the ones in the generations before survived by having<br/>
them and the ones who didn't did not, or they did but drifted in another<br/>
direction.<br/>

Natural section is the process by which<br/>
random evolutionary changes are selected for by nature in a consisted,<br/>
orderly, non-random way.<br/>
Some features are there as vestiges. Those now unused qualities might disappear<br/>
after many generations if they somehow affect the survival and transmission of<br/>
the genes.<br/>
They will have less chance of being in the next generation.<br/>

It goes without saying that they had and still have an advantageous function<br/>
and help us cope with our environment.<br/>
It's an edge against the ones with lesser brain capabilities.<br/>

As with everything else, the brain evolved.<br/>

We simply have to ask: Wouldn't it give us an advantage to be born with<br/>
some bits of knowledge about our environment?<br/>
Built-in biases or predispositions to help us deal with the world faster<br/>
instead of having to re-learn and drudge through the drudgery over and over<br/>
again?<br/>

Wouldn't it be faster to just evoke the behavior from our evolutionary past,<br/>
take some template and apply it.<br/>
<br/>
The human species is certainly having and had challenges that are recurrent;<br/>
The same set of events keep happening again and again.<br/>
<br/>
It's obvious that as a survival mean that the genes evolving a mechanism to<br/>
cope with the world faster with a low error rate would give an advantage.<br/>
<br/>
Like anything in the evolved, we can ask:<br/>
Are those remnant of the past, vestiges or do they they still apply to our<br/>
recent world?<br/>
If they are vestiges, are they inferring a disadvantage and will they disappear.<br/>
How stable are those built-in brain features.<br/>

You might have wondered one day: Why is this pattern so noticeable in humans.<br/>
Are there human universals?<br/>
<br/>
Indeed, some behaviours are common anywhere in the world regardless of the<br/>
people's origins and environment.<br/>

It might seem obvious to most people that, for example: Men focus more on sex<br/>
than women. It is so obvious that they forget to ask why and how or which of<br/>
those patterns are truly built-in.<br/>
<br/>
What are they?<br/>
<br/>
This is where the field of evolutionary psychology comes into play.<br/>
<br/>
It is about studying those predispositions and why they happen, their relation<br/>
with their environment, and if they are universal.<br/>

But does it imply biological determinism:<br/>
We have those biases, does that mean we are meant to do those things?<br/>
Are we determined?<br/>

This is a wider subject, out of scope but let's just mention that blueprints<br/>
are there as guides, as foundations, we are free to choose our lives to a<br/>
certain extent.<br/>

The field of evolutionary psychology only studies the singular behaviours,<br/>
what if you could mix them together with the environment and together with<br/>
group dynamics: social interactions.<br/>
<br/>
Let's define dynamic evolutionary psychology because it sounds like a big<br/>
complicated word.<br/>
<br/>
To understand it let's take it apart and get familiar with the terms.<br/>
<br/>
Dynamic means anything that is in movement or motion.<br/>
Evolutionary relates to the gradual adaptation to the environment, something<br/>
that has been built through time, a universal property.<br/>
Psychology is the science that deals with mental processes and behaviors.<br/>
<br/>
To sum it all, it's the relation and links behind all of our mental processes<br/>
that have been built through time, universal behaviors.<br/>
<br/>
That's what we're gonna try to achieve.<br/>

It's not as scientific as it should be because it cannot be studied on a top<br/>
down level, and we can't apply strict mathematical rules to it, numerals<br/>
measures, other than graph theory.<br/>
It's not an exact science but it's a relevant one.<br/>
However every single behaviour mentioned is backed up by multiple scientific<br/>
studies, it's just their correlations that isn't.<br/>

There are many persons reluctant to accept evolutionary psychology in today's<br/>
society.<br/>
It's not surprising that it's a controversial subject, it's normal that they<br/>
are gonna be fear talking about the biases and the correlation between<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
It's a misunderstanding, we tend to hear relation when in fact we meant<br/>
correlation. As we've said, those are all just blueprints. No predispositions,<br/>
just foundations.<br/>
<br/>
It's also a misunderstanding when some find it obvious that for instance<br/>
there's a co-relation between fearful events and people seeking more security to<br/>
protect what they cherish. It obviously seem obvious and unquestionable when<br/>

Dyn ep is an important topic to discuss because those generic rules,<br/>
psychological mechanism, are built in us to face problems our ancestors had.<br/>
It means we aren't born empty.<br/>
We don't have to follow those tendencies. But without bringing them to light<br/>
we unfortunately cannot help to avoid them.<br/>

"The genes hold the gun, the environment press the trigger."<br/>
<br/>
By understanding the regularities within our life we can better<br/>
interact with one another.<br/>
We have awoken to our own evolution.<br/>
We can modify our vision and change the world.<br/>

It's a knowledge that brings us freedom.<br/>

If we wake up to those facts we won't be bumper cars going around life driven<br/>
by predispositions.<br/>
But without opening the book of our ancestors and self-reflection we are.<br/>

Let's open it together and face the facts.<br/>
