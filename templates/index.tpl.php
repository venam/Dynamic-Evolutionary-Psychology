This project is aimed at people who are interested in evolution and psychology
and who are seeking answers to questions related to universalilty in
human psychology.<br/>
<br/>

It introduces the field of dynamic evolutionary psychology, a mix of
evolutionary psychology and social movements.
<br/>
<br/>

However, as a social science, it isnâ€™t an exact science. The field is
full of theories but even without being fully accurate the project is a
way to peak into basic human nature and to ask questions about mundane
daily behaviors.

<br/>
<br/>
The other goal is to have the explanation as clean, concise, and
direct as possible, without concealing anything and without scientific
jargon. Anyone should be able to understand those theories and claims
without having to go through research papers.
<br/>
<br/>

Nevertheless, this is at the cost of sounding wrong in some places.
